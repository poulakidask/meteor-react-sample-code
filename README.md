# meteor-react-sample-code
A starter project for React &amp; Meteor. (I used https://github.com/AdamBrodzinski/meteor-react-boilerplate as a base)

How to Install:

git clone https://github.com/poulakidask/meteor-react-sample-code

npm install

meteor 

http://localhost:3000/    

If the DateBase is empty it will create same sample data

How it Works:

Step 1  Create Employees <br/>

Step 2 Create Tasks <br/>

Step 3 Assign Tasks to Employees <br/>

Step 4 Marked them as finished and see which employee is the most productive.<br/>
(Note : Each employee get 1 point for every completed task!) <br/>
