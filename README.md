## Installation:

Download the code <br/>
```
git clone https://github.com/poulakidask/meteor-react-sample-code
```

Install the dependencies  <br/>
```
npm install
```

Start the project <br/>

If the DateBase is empty it will create some sample data. You can disable that by deleting the fixtures.js file.

## How it Works:

```
Step 1 Create Employees  

Step 2 Create Tasks  

Step 3 Assign Tasks to Employees  

Step 4 Mark the Tasks as finished and see which employee is the most productive. 

(Each employee gets 1 point for every completed task and his/her name becomes larger in the wordcloud.)

```
